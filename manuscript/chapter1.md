# Basic Building

## Village House

One thing any Minecraft survivor needs is a nice place to rest. Housing is the most common type of build in Minecraft. Villages offer a number of building templates and this build is based off of one of the larger village structures.

We'll build this in a creative world but if you consider yourself an advanced builder you could callenge yourself by changing your gamemode to survival after stocking up on supplies.

> To change gamemode create the world with cheats enabled and issue the command ```/gamemode s```.

Here is the blueprint for this building--we will build the last and largest of these structures. Each number represents a block level. There are different ways to approach the build. You can build an entire level at a time, or you could build one block at a time. Use whatever technique works best for you. You also might decide to change the design.

## Efficiency of Building Structures

Now we'll do a competition.

You must construct a house that takes up the smallest area possible. 

Your house must be contain all of the following:
* At least one Door
* At least one Workbench
* At least one Furnace
* At least one Torch
* At least one Window (must be completely surrounded by blocks)
* At least one Bed (must be able to fall asleep and wake up inside house)
* At least two Chests (can be in the form of one double or two single chests. Must be accessible)
* At least one Jukebox (must be able to play and remove music disks)

Your house's design must not use any of the required contents as exterior building material (excluding the window) (basically you should have real complete walls. No beds sticking out or furnaces in the wall, etc.) However, Items can be used as flooring.

# Survival

One of the first thing one must master in the world of Minecraft is survival. You iare dropped into the middle of a world with nothing but your bare hands. In order to survive you need to use all of your most well defined problem solving skills.

## Tool making and surviving your first night

One of the most important things a Minecraft survivor needs to do is develop tools.

There's not much else to do when developing your first set of tools than to punch a tree for wood, craft a wooden pickaxe, then (hopefully) find some stone with which to create a bevy of stone tools to use until you can source some iron.

There are some tricks to help you craft these tools just a tiny bit faster, however.

1. Wood is priority #1. If you spawn in a desert or empty island, run/swim in the direction of vegitation!
1. If there is any stone in sight, only use enough wood to craft a workbench, a pickaxe, handles for a sword, axe and shovel and some extra sticks for torches.
1. When crafting a set of tools, place enough in each part of the crafting table for multiple tools. A pickaxe, axe and shovel will all need a two stick configuration in crafting grid for their hilts. You can place three sticks in each slot when crafting all three tools at the same time (typically the first time you craft them with any given material, like your first stone tools during  your first day).

  The above configuration will produce a pickaxe and shovel before requiring more stone placement for an axe.
1. Don't forget to get enough cobble to make a furnace.
1. If there is no coal in sight or under the first layers of stone you mine, immediately go back to chopping down trees. You'll need wood to smelt charcol for torches.

### Surviving your first night exercise

Start a new world! When you spawn, it will be morning in the world of Minecraft. You'll be alone in the wilderness without any food or supplies. Tools are your top priority, as food will be difficult to obtain without them. Monsters will spawn at nighttime, so you will also need somewhere safe to stay overnight. Your challenge is simply to survive your first night in Minecraft. Explore your surroundings and decide where you're going to make your base, and then move on from there.

### Survival challenge

![Artic map \label{fig:artic}](/images/arctic-main_900_6399647.jpg)

For this challenge we'll be playing the _Artic_ map by _[ICrafting](http://www.planetminecraft.com/member/indianacrafting/)_. In this map, you are the sole survivor of a shipwreck, washed up near an artic research station. We're going to see who can survive the longest.

Additional challenges on this map are:

* Tame a dog
* Find the underwater caverns
* Find the greenhouse
* Find a grass block
* Build a house
* Make a fireplace
* Trade with Mr. Maillet
* Rescue JÃ³zsef
